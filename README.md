# Sorting Hat

Didn't you always want to know which Hogwarts house you belong to? üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

With this App you don't have to wonder any more! You are just a couple of questions away from finally knowing.

## Description

This project is my adaption of the sorting hat from Harry Potter. 
The main feature is a multi step form which takes the user through a series of question. 
I tried to focus on accessibility and keyboard usability.

## Used technologies

- React
- Storybook
- React Testing Library
- Jest

## Data

I have used this [Pottermore Sorting Hat analysis from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pottermore/comments/44os14/pottermore_sorting_hat_quiz_analysis/) as a base for the quiz questions. To make it easier to work with the data, I changed the result of each question to eithe include one or two houses as possible result.
